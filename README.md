SpaceLiberator is a game made in Unity 6 for the [last part of the Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-programming-theory-in-action). It is based on the famous Space Invaders, even if there are a few differences. It exploits completely new assets in addition to three free packages from the Unity Asset Store:
- [2D Space Backgrounds](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-space-backgrounds-39148) by Brett Gregory
- [FREE Casual Game SFX Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-54116) by Dustyroom
